# pseudocode - word guessing game

# This is the pseudocode for the game called "How do you say in Japanese?"
# The computer will show 5 random graphics. 
# The player has to guess the Japanese word for each graphic.
# Each graphic will have 4 options for the player to choose the correct word.
# For example, when the computer shows the graphic of the apple,
# 4 options would be: "1-banana", "2-mikan", "3-ringo", "4-momo"
# The computer asks, "Which is the correct option for apple?"
# The player picks one number... 
# The computer says right or wrong. (The correct answer is "3-ringo".)
# The player can play up to 5 graphics.
# At the end, the result: "You got 3 correct answers out of 5."
# Congratulate the player "Congratulation! You are genius!"
