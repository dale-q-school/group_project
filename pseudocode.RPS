#This is the Pseudocode for the Rock paper scissors program

#use the import random to being able to work some answers
#The plan was adding a for to be able to track the wrong answer so it will return the player back to the rock paper scissors introduction
#being able to choose and randomise the answers so every round will be different
#adding the different outcomes of the program like who will win 
#adding a way to count the many time have being played while the loop continues

#planning to add a difficulty mode or maybe the other version of rock paper scissors
